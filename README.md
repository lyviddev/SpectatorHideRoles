## Note:
My first plugin for SCP SL! :D

It was honestly not hard to make it. But I do see how useful this plugin can be in servers.
I made both LabAPI and EXILED versions of the plugin!

If there is any issues with the plugin, please let me know in the EXILED Discord server! I will try to fix them as best as I can!
